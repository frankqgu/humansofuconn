          <p>I got suspended for three days because I brought a ‘crossbow’ in, but it was made out of a paper tube and elastic bands. it wasn't to harm anybody it's just something cool I made. no malicious intent or anything. </p> 
          <p>These 2 kids in accelerated classes got into an actual fight. And they only got suspended for one day, whereas other kids will be suspended for weeks.</p> 
          <p>I was in school during COVID, and graduated the year after recovery. Since we missed so many events in school, they gave us each of these laptops to keep as a nice gesture. But I thought it was really thoughtful to put that investment in the youth and give every student a laptop.</p> 
          <p>I still use the laptop today, it just makes me know that like a little little things can go a long way</p>  
          <p>I think that people will bring positive aspects of education, but I think the state and the government are going to bring negative aspects of education. Stay focused, stay on track and don't really that others who tear you from achieving your dream.</p>

      <h2>Speaker Notes</h2>
      <p>Ray brought up an interesting perspective. That the government and state should be held responsible while the individuals will be empowering each other. I agree with his stance, and wanted to stage the quotes around this narrative. By state and government he is referring to statute laws, practices, and curriculum installed in place. The time he got in trouble for being misinterpreted about his crossbow is a prime example of children not understanding these zero tolerance rules while looking to expand their creativity. I specifically wanted to mention his experience of bias with the accelerated class kids. Since that made him understand education is a merit with benefits. Which contributed to his last part as he realized individuals like him can create a positive impact within their community through good education merits. Which is what he pursues today. I believe his experience of being gifted with a laptop contradicted his statement of state and government being bad, as they gave him a nice gesture of letting him keep the laptop. Perhaps it was just a graduation gift, or a consolation gift for the covid experience, but he really believed there was another person that looked out for his graduating class to bounce back from the covid setback. He saw a human working behind a state/gov that impacted the traditional routine of practice in order to bring more positivity, despite its negative connotation. Which motivates him to also reach that position to bring more positivity through his power.
