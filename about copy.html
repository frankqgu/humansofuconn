          <p>I got suspended for three days because I brought a ‘crossbow’ in, but it was made out of a paper tube and elastic bands. it wasn't to harm anybody it's just something cool I made. no malicious intent or anything. </p> 
          <p>These 2 kids in accelerated classes got into an actual fight. And they only got suspended for one day, whereas other kids will be suspended for weeks.</p> 
          <p>I was in school during COVID, and graduated the year after recovery. Since we missed so many events in school, they gave us each of these laptops to keep as a nice gesture. But I thought it was really thoughtful to put that investment in the youth and give every student a laptop.</p> 
          <p>I still use the laptop today, it just makes me know that like a little little things can go a long way</p>  
          <p>I think that people will bring positive aspects of education, but I think the state and the government are going to bring negative aspects of education. Stay focused, stay on track and don't really that others who tear you from achieving your dream.</p>

      <h2>Speaker Notes</h2>
      <p>Honore had a distinctive trait of being an immigrant. Which I related to heavily as I also immigrated to the states around the same time he did (jr.high). As such, I wanted to base his story chronologically from his middle school experiences in Rwanda, to a few challenges in high school after he came, then finally where he is in uconn and received support from individuals to help him adapt to higher education. For his unfair experience, I really wanted him to voice out his anger, to blame somebody, since I also remember that injustice feeling of everybody else around you having privileges you didn’t have. It’s especially daunting for immigrants because they never have enough leverage or communication skills to voice out those thoughts. For his positive interactions. He mentioned his counselor Carl Dean, who is also the caps director. I think having a mentor and someone to guide you when you are lost plays such an important role in your life. You will remember them forever, and they don’t even have to do that much. I had a similar figure 4 years ago when I needed guidance, and I will forever be grateful to him for reaffirming my self confidence. Lastly, I was surprised by his attitude on the future of education. It never dawned on me my influences toward my future offsprings, and how they will feel in the future. After he mentioned how his kids will feel belonged here. I will aim to do the same to make sure my future kids feel belonged too.
