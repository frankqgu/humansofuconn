          <p>I remember my gym teacher, he knew I needed a laptop, and he entered me into this raffle. I didn’t really give it a thought…but I ended up winning a laptop, and I’m using it right now.</p> 
          <p>Nowadays tho, The system is broken. There are just not enough jobs to get paid. yes, it's a little bit of a passion but like, it's not all their passion. people just put themselves in front when it comes to interviews, you really don't know someone's intentions.</p> 
          <p>I always liked to sit in the front of the class to try paying attention. But this one teacher would not let me sit in the front. Everytime, they would tell me to go to the back even though I've worked better in the front. So I had poor vision sitting in the back, getting no help.</p> 
          <p>The education system is just trying to get you through high school. Like, they're just trying to get you out of here to do their job. Not, oh, I should care for you or, make sure you understand this content. Like Listen, just let me get you out of here.</p>
          <p>Just stay out of trouble and good things come out your way. Others will notice your hardwork.</p>

      <h2>Speaker Notes</h2>
      <p>Nate was a lively kid. He was very enthusiastic about learning, which is why his blow is the hardest in my opinion. If I have to hypothesize, the reason why the teacher did not allow him to sit in the front is because he was concentrating too much, to the point where he was annoying the teacher. Frankly, I still have the same problem. It’s a hard realization that many of the positive and caring interactions you take for granted in an education setting (counselors, teachers, staff) are only done because it’s their job. They only do enough to make you comfortable, but the second you require more effort and more time from them, the mood shifts. I believe that it’s also why he had a negative attitude towards the future of learning, similar to me. However, his experience with winning a laptop raffle played side to side with his skills. It reaffirmed to him that there are people who cared about him, such as his gym teacher. It was still just a small gesture to enter the raffle, but that gesture went a long way for him as he realized the importance of connections. These 2 polar opposite relationships with teachers allowed him to start evaluating other people within these narratives, and taught his social etiquette and human management skills.
