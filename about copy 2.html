          <p>I remember my gym teacher, he knew I needed a laptop, and he entered me into this raffle. I didn’t really give it a thought…but I ended up winning a laptop, and I’m using it right now.</p> 
          <p>Nowadays tho, The system is broken. There are just not enough jobs to get paid. yes, it's a little bit of a passion but like, it's not all their passion. people just put themselves in front when it comes to interviews, you really don't know someone's intentions.</p> 
          <p>I always liked to sit in the front of the class to try paying attention. But this one teacher would not let me sit in the front. Everytime, they would tell me to go to the back even though I've worked better in the front. So I had poor vision sitting in the back, getting no help.</p> 
          <p>The education system is just trying to get you through high school. Like, they're just trying to get you out of here to do their job. Not, oh, I should care for you or, make sure you understand this content. Like Listen, just let me get you out of here.</p>
          <p>Just stay out of trouble and good things come out your way. Others will notice your hardwork.</p>

      <h2>Speaker Notes</h2>
      <p>Honore had a distinctive trait of being an immigrant. Which I related to heavily as I also immigrated to the states around the same time he did (jr.high). As such, I wanted to base his story chronologically from his middle school experiences in Rwanda, to a few challenges in high school after he came, then finally where he is in uconn and received support from individuals to help him adapt to higher education. For his unfair experience, I really wanted him to voice out his anger, to blame somebody, since I also remember that injustice feeling of everybody else around you having privileges you didn’t have. It’s especially daunting for immigrants because they never have enough leverage or communication skills to voice out those thoughts. For his positive interactions. He mentioned his counselor Carl Dean, who is also the caps director. I think having a mentor and someone to guide you when you are lost plays such an important role in your life. You will remember them forever, and they don’t even have to do that much. I had a similar figure 4 years ago when I needed guidance, and I will forever be grateful to him for reaffirming my self confidence. Lastly, I was surprised by his attitude on the future of education. It never dawned on me my influences toward my future offsprings, and how they will feel in the future. After he mentioned how his kids will feel belonged here. I will aim to do the same to make sure my future kids feel belonged too.
